# Topic and motivation

In this analysis, I demonstrate that violent crime is much more common in some parts of Washington, DC than in others. The motivation for the assignment is an uptick in crime in the city in recent years that has received substantial media attention. Lawmakers and policymakers need to keep variation in homicides, sex abuses, assaults with dangerous weapons, and robberies between wards and neighborhood clusters in mind when designing programs aimed at curbing violent crime.

```

This bar graph shows the number of violent crimes that happened in each of the eight wards of Washington, DC in 2021. The ward where the most violent crimes happened was Ward 7 (917 cases) and the ward where the fewest violent crimes happened was Ward 3 (79). In total, there were 4,106 violent crimes in 2021.

Wards 7 and 8 are high-poverty and have large populations of African Americans. The bar graph helps explain why residents of those wards are especially worried about violent crime.

Note that Open Data DC categorizes homicides, sex abuses, assaults with dangerous weapons, and robberies as violent crimes. Meanwhile, Open Data DC categorizes arson, burglaries, theft with auto, and theft/other as property crimes. This may be a different way of defining violent crime than is used by other researchers but it is the conceptualization that I am using. (There were 24,208 property crimes in 2021, which is not shown in the graph.)

graph2
```

This faceted bar graph shows the number of assaults with dangerous weapons, homicides, robberies, and sex abuses that happened in each of the eight wards of Washington, DC in 2021. The graph suggests that homicides and sex abuses were relatively rare compared to the other two types of violent crime. In addition, the graph shows that assaults with dangerous weapons and robberies were especially likely to happen in Wards 7 and 8 but were rare in Ward 3. Variation in the frequency of homicides and sex abuses between wards were much smaller.

The bar graph suggests that simply counting the number of violent crimes in each ward, as Graph 1 does, is not telling the full story. Rather, we need to break down the numbers by offense type in order to fully understand crime in Washington, DC.
